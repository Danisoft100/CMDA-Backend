## 📦 Ready to Deploy

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (Local)
```powershell
cd C:\Users\CMD\cmda\CMDA-Backend
npm install resend
```

### Step 2: Build Project (Local)
```powershell
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Droplet
```bash
# SSH into droplet
ssh root@64.23.254.48

cd /var/www/cmda-backend

# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Install dependencies
npm install resend

# Add Resend API key to .env
nano .env
# Add this line:
# RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here

# Build
npm run build

# Restart
pm2 restart all

# Verify
pm2 logs --lines 30
```

### Step 4: Get Resend API Key
1. Go to https://resend.com
2. Sign up (free - 3,000 emails/month)
3. Go to API Keys
4. Create new key
5. Copy key (starts with `re_`)
6. Add to `.env` on droplet

## 🎯 What This Solves

### Before:
- ❌ Requests timeout at 60 seconds
- ❌ "110: Connection timed out" nginx errors
- ❌ "Error on email server" messages
- ❌ Users can't signup/reset passwords
- ❌ Single point of failure (SMTP only)

### After:
- ✅ 300-second timeout (5 minutes)
- ✅ 45-second email timeout protection
- ✅ Automatic fallback to Resend if SMTP fails
- ✅ Requests complete in 5-45 seconds
- ✅ Users can signup/reset passwords successfully
- ✅ Redundant email system
- ✅ Better error logging

## 📊 How the Fallback Works

```
User Request (signup/forgot password)
    ↓
Try Primary SMTP (45s timeout)
    ↓
✓ Success? → User gets email via SMTP
    ↓
✗ Failed? → Try Resend (automatic)
    ↓
✓ Success? → User gets email via Resend
    ↓
✗ Both failed? → Error logged, user notified
```

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Check Email Service Status
```bash
pm2 logs | grep -i email
```

Look for:
- ✅ `"Resend fallback service initialized"` - Fallback ready
- ✅ `"email sent via primary SMTP"` - Primary working
- ⚠️  `"Primary email failed, trying Resend fallback"` - Using fallback
- ✅ `"email sent via Resend fallback"` - Fallback working
- ❌ `"All email services failed"` - Both failed (rare)

### Check Nginx Timeouts
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log | grep timeout
```

Should see NO new timeout errors after deployment.

## 📝 Environment Variables Needed

```env
# Primary SMTP (existing)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.your-provider.com
EMAIL_PORT=465
EMAIL_USER=your-email@domain.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-password
EMAIL_FROM=CMDA Nigeria <noreply@cmdanigeria.net>

# Resend Fallback (NEW - add this)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key_here
```

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### Test 1: Forgot Password
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.cmdanigeria.net/auth/forgot-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "your-test@gmail.com"}'
```

Should complete in 5-15 seconds (not 60+)

### Test 2: Signup
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.cmdanigeria.net/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "newuser@example.com",
    "password": "Test123!",
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
    "phone": "1234567890",
    "role": "STUDENT",
    "region": "FCT",
    "admissionYear": "2020",
    "yearOfStudy": "4",
    "medicalSchool": "Test School",
    "gender": "male"
  }'
```

Should complete successfully and user receives email.
