# Onboarding Email Fallback Implementation

## Overview
All onboarding and authentication-related emails now use Resend as the primary delivery method with SMTP as a fallback for maximum reliability.

## Email Methods with Resend Fallback

### ✅ Onboarding & Authentication Emails
All these emails now have Resend → SMTP fallback:

1. **`sendWelcomeEmail`** - New user welcome email with verification code
   - Subject: "Welcome to CMDA Nigeria"
   - Triggers: User signup
   - Contains: Verification code

2. **`sendVerificationCodeEmail`** - Email verification code
   - Subject: "Complete your CMDA Nigeria registration"
   - Triggers: User needs to verify email
   - Contains: 6-digit verification code
   - Timeout: 45 seconds

3. **`sendPasswordResetTokenEmail`** - Password reset request
   - Subject: "Password Reset Request"
   - Triggers: User requests password reset
   - Contains: Reset token/code
   - Timeout: 45 seconds

4. **`sendPasswordResetSuccessEmail`** ✨ NEW - Password reset confirmation
   - Subject: "Password Reset Successful"
   - Triggers: After successful password reset
   - Contains: Confirmation message

5. **`sendAdminCredentialsEmail`** ✨ NEW - Admin account credentials
   - Subject: "Admin Login Credentials"
   - Triggers: Admin creates new admin account
   - Contains: Email and temporary password

6. **`sendMemberCredentialsEmail`** ✨ NEW - Member account credentials
   - Subject: "CMDA Member Account Credentials"
   - Triggers: Admin creates new member account
   - Contains: Email and temporary password

7. **`sendTransitionSuccessEmail`** ✨ NEW - Role transition confirmation
   - Subject: "Transition Successful"
   - Triggers: User role changes (e.g., Student → Doctor)
   - Contains: Old role, new role, license number, region, specialty

## Benefits

### For Onboarding:
1. **Higher Success Rate** - Resend has better deliverability than SMTP
2. **Faster Delivery** - Resend API is faster than traditional SMTP
3. **Better UX** - Users receive verification codes quickly
4. **Reliability** - Two delivery methods ensure emails get through
5. **Monitoring** - Detailed logging for troubleshooting

### For User Credentials:
1. **Secure Delivery** - Critical credentials use the most reliable path
2. **Admin Confidence** - Admins can trust that credentials are delivered
3. **Audit Trail** - Logs show which delivery method succeeded

### For Role Transitions:
1. **Important Notifications** - Users are reliably informed of status changes
2. **Professional Experience** - Fast, reliable delivery for milestone events

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required:
```env
# Resend API (Primary)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx

# SMTP (Fallback)
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASS=your-app-password
MAIL_FROM=noreply@cmdanigeria.org
```

## Logging

All email methods now log:
- ✅ Success via Resend API
- ⚠️ Resend failure with fallback attempt
- ✅ Success via SMTP fallback
- ❌ Complete failure (both methods failed)

Example logs:
```
[EmailService] Welcome email sent via Resend API
[EmailService] Resend failed: API key invalid. Trying SMTP fallback...
[EmailService] Verification email sent via SMTP fallback
[EmailService] All email services failed for password reset email
```

## Testing Checklist

### User Onboarding Flow:
- [ ] Sign up → Welcome email received (Resend)
- [ ] Sign up → Verification code email received (Resend)
- [ ] Verify email → Code accepted
- [ ] Forgot password → Reset email received (Resend)
- [ ] Reset password → Success email received (Resend)

### Admin Operations:
- [ ] Create admin → Credentials email received (Resend)
- [ ] Create member → Credentials email received (Resend)

### Role Transitions:
- [ ] Student → Doctor → Transition email received (Resend)
- [ ] Doctor → GlobalNetwork → Transition email received (Resend)

### Fallback Testing:
- [ ] Disable Resend API → Emails still sent via SMTP
- [ ] Invalid SMTP config + No Resend → Failure logged properly

## Emails Still Using SMTP Only

The following emails currently use SMTP only (not critical for onboarding):

1. `sendDonationConfirmedEmail` - Donation confirmation
2. `sendSubscriptionConfirmedEmail` - Subscription confirmation
3. `sendConferenceRegistrationConfirmationEmail` - Conference registration
4. `sendConferencePaymentConfirmationEmail` - Conference payment
5. `sendConferenceUpdateNotificationEmail` - Conference updates

**Recommendation**: Add Resend fallback to these in a future update if email delivery issues occur.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Emails not being sent
**Check:**
1. Is `RESEND_API_KEY` set in environment?
2. Are SMTP credentials valid?
3. Check application logs for specific errors

### Issue: Slow email delivery
**Check:**
1. Resend API should be fast (<2 seconds)
2. If using SMTP fallback, expect 5-45 seconds
3. Consider upgrading SMTP server or fixing Resend API

### Issue: Verification codes not received
**Check:**
1. Spam/junk folder
2. Email address is valid
3. Check logs to see which delivery method was used
4. Verify Resend API quota not exceeded

## Future Improvements

1. **Add retry logic** - Retry failed emails after delay
2. **Queue system** - Use Bull/Redis for email queue management
3. **Template versioning** - Version control for email templates
4. **A/B testing** - Test different email formats
5. **Analytics** - Track open rates, click rates
6. **Unsubscribe handling** - Manage email preferences
7. **Batch sending** - Send multiple emails efficiently

## Deployment Notes

### Before Deploying:
1. Ensure `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in production environment
2. Verify SMTP credentials are valid
3. Test email sending in staging environment
4. Monitor logs for any fallback patterns

### After Deploying:
1. Monitor email delivery success rates
2. Check for increased Resend API usage
3. Verify no emails are failing completely
4. Review logs for any SMTP fallback usage (indicates Resend issues)
